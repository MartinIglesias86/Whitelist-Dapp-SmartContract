# Smart Contract to interact with a dApp to add addresses to a whitelist.

In this project I'm going to use [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to create an app to add addresses to a withelist, with the deployment of the Smart Contract on
the Rinkeby test net.

## Test deploy
Smart contract deployed in [Rinkeby Testnet Network](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8e4e5184c20bb65415234d077adeaab71a6fba7b)

## Requirements
* Whitelist access should be given to the first 10 users for free who want to get in.
* There should be a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.<br><br>
